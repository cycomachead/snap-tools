# snap-tools

Snap<i>!</i>-tools is a collection of custom blocks and extensions built for the 
[Snap<i>!</i>][snap] programming language. Most of these rely on the 
`reportJSFunction` block which allows native JS to be executed within Snap<i>!</i>.

## Usage

The easiest way to use these blocks is to download the repo and then use the 
"Import" menu within Snap<i>!</i>.

## Tools

### Simple Text Labels
See `text-stamping.xml` for this block. This allows native text stamping on the 
stage. It uses a monospace font and will use the current pen color and stamp 
text at the same angle as the sprite. If the pen is down, the text appears underlined.
